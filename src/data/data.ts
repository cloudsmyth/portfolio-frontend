		'my React and Node skills with a unique fully JSON configurable frontend that serves up four distinct applications from a monorepo. ' +
		'My most recent project was to build and maintain a RAG system to help streamline the data gathering process during and after a loan origination system. ' +
		'This project has exposed me to a litany of different techniques that can be used to guide, utilize, and refine AI powered workflows, including when ' +
		"to push for a little more optimization from the LLM, and when to build out an intuitive human-in-the-loop interface to bridge a gap that can't quite be filled yet. " +
		'While I am not yet writing Go professionally, I have been committed to learning more about it with my time on the Boot.dev website and learning platform. ' +
		"I just recently acquired the title of 'Archmage', and have started to use what I have learned there to build some terminal applications for things I enjoy like Magic: The Gathering. " +
		'When I am not hanging out around my computer, I still enjoy creating with my hands. Whether it be an old reliable of building a new Lego set, or taking the plunge into ' +
		'the wonderful world of knitting with a beginner friendly Wobbles set, creating something from seemingly random parts will forever be a source of joy for me.'
